# Quotes Generator

Today, We'll be building a random quotes generator using an API in React. This will basically give you an idea of handling APIs in React.

Here's the [source code](https://codesandbox.io/s/random-quotes-generator-rzfit).

## Part 1: Prerequisites

You should know some basics of React and I recommend you to follow [this](https://workshops.hackclub.com/nextjs_starter/) workshop before proceeding further. If you're having trouble, feel free to ask [me](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/user_profile/U014ND5P1N2) or anyone in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/)!

## Part 2: Setup

For writing our code, we'll be using [CodeSandbox](codesandbox.io) which turns out to be the best online code editor for React.

To get started, go to this [starter code](https://codesandbox.io/s/quotesgeneratorstartercode-29ffd). Press **`ctrl+s`** / **`cmd+s`** and it will automatically fork it for you. Now, we have everything set up so let's get started!

## Part 3: Building the project

### 1) Inspecting the starter code

Let's first have a look at our project's starter code.
