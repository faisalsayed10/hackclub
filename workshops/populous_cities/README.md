# Populous Cities

Today, We'll be creating a simple bubbles map using a popular JavaScript library [`Leaflet`](https://leafletjs.com/). In fact the React version of it - [`React-Leaflet`](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).

Here's the [source code](https://codesandbox.io/s/populous-cities-9jq66).

## Part 1: Prerequisites

You should know the basics of React and I recommend you to follow [this](https://workshops.hackclub.com/react_calendar/) workshop before proceeding further. If you're having trouble, feel free to ask [me](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/user_profile/U014ND5P1N2) or anyone in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/)!

## Part 2: Setup

For writing our code, we'll be using [CodeSandbox](codesandbox.io) which turns out to be the best online code editor for creating React apps.

Go to this [starter code](https://react.new). Press **`ctrl+s`** / **`cmd+s`** and it will automatically fork it for you. Now, we have everything set up so let's get started!

## Part 3: Building the project
